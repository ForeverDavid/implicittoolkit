The Implicit Toolkit
====================

The Implicit Toolkit is a set of simple tools for computing and visualizing implicit representations of geometry. The output of this code is targeted at rigid body simulation with the [SCISim engine](https://github.com/breannansmith/scisim), but is suitably general for use in [other simulation frameworks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_DdAXV3IDw).
